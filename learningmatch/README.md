## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory (where package.json and other config files are):
   ```bash
   cd learningmatch/learningmatch
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

Check /learningmatch/public/users.json to view Userdata and login, or signup with your own credentials (any work)
Only specific buttons have functionality: Log In, Sign Up, Logout, User Profile (and everything in that page), University Suggestions. The rest are just for show.
